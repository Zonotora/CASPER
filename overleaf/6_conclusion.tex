The results look promising. We have shown that scheduling requests and provisioning computing units across different regions successfully decreases total carbon emissions when there is a significant carbon intensity differential between regions. This supports previous research showing this differential lies around $30\%$ for the US. However, more work is needed for a more thorough analysis.
