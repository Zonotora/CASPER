%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  The problem

We have an exponential projection of compute, and power efficieny in hardware is no longer getting exponentially better (end of Dennard scaling, moore’s law) hence we must start considering the footprint of computation.

 The opportunity:
the intermittent nature of renewable energy and the possibility to move computations to energy instead of the reverse allows for a carbon aware scheduler (CAS).

Data center’s power difference between maximum and minimum states are only a few percent, hence curtailments is a problem.
